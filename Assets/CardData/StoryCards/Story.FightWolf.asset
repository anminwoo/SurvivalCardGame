  explanation: You started fighting with the wolf. When the wolf rushes in you, you
    pushed the wolf away.  You picked up a stone from the ground and threw it hard.
    Luckily, the stone hits the wolf in the face and the wolf runs away. There were
    scratches when you pushed the wolf, but I don't think it's that serious.
